I enjoy learning more and working in different research fields - Speech(Production, TTS, ASR), Vision(Unsupervised), Reinforcement Learning(Bandits!). I am currently employed at SPIRE Lab, IISc, Bangalore on a Speech recognition project on Indian languages, funded by Gates Foundation. Previously, I worked at a startup - MyHealthcareAI, on various vision, NLP, speech DL tasks. I completed my undergrad in 2019, during which we won the best project award for Material defect detection and SNR improvement with DL algorithms.

<b>I will be applying for PhD programs at the end of this year for 2022 intake. While I'm not restricted to work on a specific domain, I'm keen on contributing to areas such as -
<ul>
<li>Multi-modal learning</li>
<li>Generative modelling (variational methods, flows etc)</li>
</ul>
<b>Do reach out to me if you find me to be a good candidate for your group!</b>
